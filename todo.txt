When compiling season stats: check first if two teams playing each other are both due for the same outcome, if so fade; check if two teams playing each other are due for opposite outcomes; if so, add unit bets (up to three? four?)
Check with dad: if you bet 3 units, is that considered 3 wins?

If two teams playing each other are both due for the same outcome, do not recommend this game to bet on - have them both listed, but note to fade this game
If two teams playing each other are due for opposite outcomes, add units on this bet
Should it still be split into "Teams due for win" and "Teams due for loss"?
